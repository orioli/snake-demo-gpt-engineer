Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the snake game implementation:

1. Model:
- Snake: Represents the snake in the game. Responsible for maintaining the snake's position, length, and movement.
- Food: Represents the food in the game. Responsible for generating new food positions.

2. View:
- GameView: Responsible for rendering the game screen and displaying the snake, food, and score.

3. Controller:
- GameController: Responsible for handling user input and updating the game state accordingly.

4. Main:
